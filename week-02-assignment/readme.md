### How do you know

This week I was introduced to a number of development technologies that I had not previously known about. These included

- git
- github
- the Atom text editor
- and the markdown language.

I wasn't really sure and understand fully about what a text file is, but I'm getting in it. I hope I could do better in next assignment. This is my website. (https://hyeinkang.wordpress.com)

I will try harder next time to do assignment. Following is my decision for this semester.

1. Do everything beforehand.
2. Don't be lame.

Finally, I did enjoy setting up my text editor, Atom, this week. Even though, I had hard time push it to github.
