This week I was introduced to a number of different development technologies about HTML. These includes:

- Tag
- Elements (Head/Body)
- Comments
- Doctype Declaration

I learned the basic structure of HTML. Below is the structure.

<html>
   <body>
     <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
     <p> This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
     <h2>This is a sub-headings</h2>
     <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings</p>
     <h2>another sub-heading</h2>
     <p>Here you can see another sub-heading</p>
   </body>
</html>

There are two things what I was interested in this week assignment.

1. Learning the language of HTML
2. Making a website with HTML

It was interested that I can make a website with HTML and there is a proper structure for the HTML. I want to make my own website by using HTML at the end of this semester.

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
