<p>Technical Report</p>
<br>
<p>In this week, I learned deeper about different kinds of elements that we can use while building out website.</p>
<br>
<p>It was fun to learn different kinds of text input elements, text area element, radio buttons, checkbox element, select box, search box element, the button element, and etc. </p>

1. I built the website asking which type of K-pop girl group do you like by using radio buttons.
2. I added a question asking about which one do you prefer k-pop or j-pop by using select box.
