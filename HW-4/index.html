  <strong><h1>Pesto Pasta with Chicken</h1></strong>
  <hr>
  <em>"Easy and delicious pasta with chicken. Serve with crusty bread
    and salad for a quick dinner. Use as much
    or as little pesto sauce as you like.
    Using homemade pesto will taste even better,
    but it adds to prep time. Enjoy!"</em>
